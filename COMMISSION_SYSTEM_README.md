# Commission System Implementation

## 📋 Pseudo Code Summary

This commission system implements a **commission-based revenue model** for your hotel booking platform where you earn a percentage from each booking while paying property owners the remainder.

### 💰 Commission Flow Logic

```
BOOKING PROCESS WITH COMMISSION:

1. Customer books property
   └── Amount: 10,000 FCFA deducted from customer wallet
   
2. Commission calculation (10% example)
   ├── Platform commission: 10,000 × 10% = 1,000 FCFA
   └── Property owner payout: 10,000 - 1,000 = 9,000 FCFA
   
3. Automatic processing
   ├── Property owner wallet credited with 9,000 FCFA
   ├── Platform keeps 1,000 FCFA commission
   ├── Transaction recorded in commission tracking
   └── Notifications sent to property owner

4. Admin dashboard shows
   ├── Total commission earned
   ├── Property owner payouts processed
   └── Platform analytics and earnings
```

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### New Tables Created:
- **`tbl_commission_settings`** - Stores commission rate and payout settings
- **`tbl_commission_tracking`** - Tracks each booking's commission data
- **`tbl_property_owner_payouts`** - Records all payouts to property owners
- **`tbl_platform_earnings`** - Daily summary of platform earnings

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. Database Setup
- **`commission_system_setup.sql`** - Database schema and tables

### 2. Enhanced Booking System
- **`user_api/u_book_with_commission.php`** - Booking system with commission processing

### 3. Admin Management
- **`commission_admin_dashboard.php`** - Complete admin panel for commission management

### 4. Property Owner APIs
- **`user_api/u_property_owner_earnings.php`** - API for property owners to view earnings

### 5. Documentation
- **`COMMISSION_SYSTEM_README.md`** - This documentation file

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the commission system setup
mysql -u your_user -p your_database < commission_system_setup.sql
```

### 2. Update Commission Settings
Visit `/commission_admin_dashboard.php` and configure:
- **Commission Rate**: Default 10% (adjustable)
- **Payout Timing**: Immediate, After Check-in, or Manual
- **Minimum Payout**: Default 100 FCFA
- **Auto Payout**: Enable/disable automatic payouts

### 3. Replace Booking System
```php
// Replace your current u_book.php with the new commission-enabled version
// Or integrate the commission processing functions into your existing booking system
```

## 💡 How It Works

### Booking Flow
1. **Customer books property** → Wallet deducted (existing functionality)
2. **Commission calculated** → Based on admin-set percentage
3. **Property owner credited** → Receives booking amount minus commission
4. **Platform earnings tracked** → Commission stored for analytics
5. **Notifications sent** → Property owner notified of payout

### Commission Calculation
```php
$commission_amount = ($booking_amount * $commission_rate) / 100;
$owner_payout = $booking_amount - $commission_amount;
```

### Payout Options
- **Immediate**: Property owner paid upon booking confirmation
- **After Check-in**: Payout processed when guest checks in
- **Manual**: Admin manually approves each payout
