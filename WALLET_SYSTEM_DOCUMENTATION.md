6. Booking status updated to `CONFIRMED`

### 2. **Refund Process**

1. User requests refund or booking is cancelled
2. System calls `processRefund()` with refund details
3. Refund amount added to guest's wallet
4. Refund amount deducted from host's wallet
5. Booking status updated to `REFUNDED`
6. Email notifications sent to both parties

### 3. **Withdrawal Process**

1. User requests withdrawal from wallet
2. System validates sufficient balance
3. Withdrawal transaction created
4. External withdrawal processed (Fapshi, bank, etc.)
5. Wallet balance updated
6. Email notification sent to user
